# Cement Strength 

## Overview
This repository contains analysis and predictive modeling of concrete compressive strength based on its composition and age. The dataset includes various components of the concrete mix and the resulting compressive strength, measured in MPa (megapascals).

## Contents
- `cement_data.csv`: The dataset used for analysis, containing details about the concrete components and their compressive strength.
- `eda.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the dataset.
- `cementStrength.ipynb`: Analysis notebook focusing on the relationships between different components and the strength of the cement.
- `cement_strength.ipynb`: Additional analysis and insights into the dataset.
- `cement_strength_prediction.ipynb`: A notebook demonstrating predictive modeling for the compressive strength of the concrete.

## Dataset
The dataset `cement_data.csv` includes the following columns:
1. `Cement (component 1)(kg in a m^3 mixture)`: Amount of cement in the mixture (kg/m³).
2. `Blast Furnace Slag (component 2)(kg in a m^3 mixture)`: Amount of blast furnace slag (kg/m³).
3. `Fly Ash (component 3)(kg in a m^3 mixture)`: Amount of fly ash (kg/m³).
4. `Water (component 4)(kg in a m^3 mixture)`: Amount of water (kg/m³).
5. `Superplasticizer (component 5)(kg in a m^3 mixture)`: Amount of superplasticizer (kg/m³).
6. `Coarse Aggregate (component 6)(kg in a m^3 mixture)`: Amount of coarse aggregate (kg/m³).
7. `Fine Aggregate (component 7)(kg in a m^3 mixture)`: Amount of fine aggregate (kg/m³).
8. `Age (day)`: Age of the concrete (days).
9. `Concrete compressive strength(MPa, megapascals)`: Compressive strength of the concrete (MPa).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The `eda.ipynb` notebook includes:
- Descriptive statistics of the data.
- Visualizations such as histograms and correlation heatmaps.
- Analysis of the distribution of different components in the mixture.
- Insights into the relationships between mixture components and concrete strength.

## Predictive Modeling
In `cement_strength_prediction.ipynb`, we explore:
- Building machine learning models to predict the compressive strength of concrete.
- Model evaluation and selection based on performance metrics.
